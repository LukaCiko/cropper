## Download

To import Cropper, add the following dependency to your Gradle build script:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.lukaciko.cropper:cropper:0.1@aar'
}
```

## How do I use Cropper?

Cropper provides a convenient fluent interface with which you can specify optional parameter. Use Cropper by calling `crop` method.

``` java
Cropper.crop(context, imageSourceUri, savePathUri)
    .aspectRatio(16, 9)
    .circleCrop(true)
    .start(context);
```

An image cropping activity will be started. Get the cropped bitmap by overriding `onActivityResult` method, checking if request code is `Cropper.CROP` and getting the `Cropper.SAVE_PATH` String extra.

Cropper also provides an `pick` convenience method which starts an image picking activity. Here's an example of `onActivityResult` method when using `pick` method to pick the image and `crop` method to crop it afterwards:

``` java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data)
{
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    if (requestCode == Cropper.PICK && data != null)
    {
        Uri uri = data.getData();

        File file = new File(getExternalFilesDir(null), "cropped_image.png");

        Cropper.crop(getApplicationContext(), uri, Uri.fromFile(file)).start(this);
    }
    else if (requestCode == Cropper.CROP && data != null)
    {
        String croppedBitmapPath = data.getStringExtra(Cropper.SAVE_PATH);
        // Get cropped bitmap by running BitmapFactory.decodeFile(croppedBitmapPath);
    }
}
```
